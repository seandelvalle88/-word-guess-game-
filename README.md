## Description & Requirements
---
For this assignment we were required to build a dynamic word guess web application using Javascript . We were tasked with dyncamilly displaying items to the DOM, using event listeners, methods and making use of loops and arrays to determine outcomes. 

I chose The legandary wu tang clan for my theme!

## Rules of the Game

Each round the computer will randomnly select a word for the player to guess. A player will receive 10 guesses (Guess Count) to try and guess the randomly selected word. Each correct guess will replace the corresponding _ with the letter and will NOT change the Guess Count.

        ex. 
                hidden word: _ _ _ _ _

                user guess : 'b'

                result     : b _ _ b _


 Each *incorrect* guess will deduct one guess will display the letter in the Incorrect Guess Display and take the Guess Count down one. If the user can guess the word correctly before the Guess Count gets down to 0 they win the game. If the cannot, they will have to try again!



## How it Works

1. Using a document ready function, the game is comprised of 3 functions. 

    * startGame(): is run at the start of the game
        1. Sets the Guess Count to 10
        2. Empties Incorrect Guess Display
        3. Randomly selects a word from the words array
        4. Takes the randomly selected word and splits the word up into a new letters array for the player to guess
        5. Replaces each letter and replaces it with underscores to be displayed on the DOM
        

    * checkLetters(): is run every time the player makes a guess
        1. Takes the user letter selection by listening for a button press
        2. Checks the user guess against those in the new array
        3. It returns a true value if the letter is correc and a false value if the guess is incorrect. 

    * roundFinish(): runs after a guess is made and until the game conclusion.
        1. Updates the DOM displays with scores, guesses and guess count
        2. Runs code that will alert the player when the game is won or lost
        3. Calls the startGame() function
        
### Notes

This was super hard but I had a lot of help/fun with a mentor/peer of mine.
